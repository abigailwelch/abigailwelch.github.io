trying to make sense of it all...

Languages that I had used were css, html, and some javascript that I had adapted from the w3 schools website. I utlized css grid from a zip file that we had used for my image gallery. Hover effects for my tabs I had made with just basic css, and the javascript I adapted for my draggable dooda character that appears in the top left corner of the page. This project was so much for me at first but I eventually got the hang of it and I feel like I know so much more about coding now and can solve a lot of my issues and bugs. I gained a lot of understabding with mobile vs desktop configurations and I'm most definitely still learning things everyday. I have a lot of plans for adding more to my website in the summer time so I'm super excited to see how much more it will develop. Thank you !!!

goals for summer + beyond:
working with scaling of graphics/assets so they look the proportionally the best on both operating systems
add business card project
making a dark mode
making a back to top button
make certain things open in new tabs
make subpages
make secret page

successfully have a beautiful working mobile grid!! it looks exactly the way i want it to :)). i also got dooda to disappear in mobile version since they aren't interactive there. perhaps i will make them work there soon though?? who knows! super excited though it looks just the way i've intended it to which is so awesome. next things i've got to work on... adding the art, design and me pages, changing footer a little bit by maybe adding fun gif or somethin and maybe some more!

added code adapted from w3 schools online into html and css and it is working! need to wait for server to catch up to test actual usability of it. javascript is still in html because it wont work when in main.js for some reason. next addition should be buttons!
