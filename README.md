trying to make sense of it all...

successfully have a beautiful working mobile grid!! it looks exactly the way i want it to :)). i also got dooda to disappear in mobile version since they aren't interactive there. perhaps i will make them work there soon though?? who knows! super excited though it looks just the way i've intended it to which is so awesome. next things i've got to work on... adding the art, design and me pages, changing footer a little bit by maybe adding fun gif or somethin and maybe some more!

added code adapted from w3 schools online into html and css and it is working! need to wait for server to catch up to test actual usability of it. javascript is still in html because it wont work when in main.js for some reason. next addition should be buttons!
